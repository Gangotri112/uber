        <p>“Seven elephants --- three adults and four calves --- were killed in the accident while one calf sustained injuries. We are conducting postmortem of all the carcasses,” Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) of Nagaon forest division Suhas Kadam said.
            According to Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) officials, the incident took place at 2.17 am in the Jamunamukh–Kampur section under the Lumding division. “However, there are no casualties or injuries to any passenger. The area is about 126 km away from Guwahati. Accident relief trains, along with officials from the divisional headquarters, are already at the site,” the NFR said in a statement.

Passengers of the affected coaches have been temporarily accommodated in vacant berths available in other coaches.

“The derailed train, after detaching the affected coaches, has left the site for Guwahati. Once the train reaches Guwahati, additional coaches will be added to accommodate the passengers of the affected coaches, and the train will resume its journey,” the statement added.
